# matmul-optimizer

This is something I worked on in November 2022.

The code makes a tensor rank decomposition on the matrix multiplication tensor via gradient descent. 
These decompositions are essential for finding optimal matrix multiplication algorithms. 
The cost function used for gradient descent is the mean squared error in tensor entries.
